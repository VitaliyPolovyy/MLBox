=====  Whatâ€™s the best way to store different literal values, like the Hugging Face token, repository and file names?
Now, I created in root dir  ".env" file with 
# Hugging Face API data
HF_REPO_ID=PolovyyVitaliy/peanuts-seg-yolo8s
HF_MODEL_FILE=yolov8m-seg_v1.pt
ANSWER: yes, this is exactly how it is done


===== Hugginface: what scenario? 
-Store multiple model files in a single Hugging Face repository.
-Use a clear naming convention for each model file (e.g., yolo8s_seg_peanuts_v1.pt).
-Document each version in the README.md (model card) to provide details on training configurations, datasets, and hyperparameters.
Is it better to store one file but different versions of it?
ANSWER: one file with different version. 


===== Poetry env loction
root@COMB-CO-157:/mnt/c/My storage/Python projects/MLBox# poetry env info --path
/root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/mlbox-uNx4hJXb-py3.10
Should I remove env folders to project folder?
The issue is that I have to manually run the 'poetry shell' command each time I open the project.
ANSWER: pyenv created envirement. Poetry deals with this envirement.
poetry install
poetry add
poetry remove
poetry lock

===== Huggingface certificate problem
My computer doesn\t trust huggingface.co (when "model_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id=hf_repo_id, filename=hf_model_file, token=hf_token)")
ANSWER: poetry add "requests==2.27.1"

===== Location of model weight file which downloaded from Huggingface
1. default system location?
2. the project folder for better management?
ANSWER: location of this file is not your problem. You shouldn't worry about this

===== What is the concept of using pathlib to manage paths?
My version:
MLBox\mlbox\settings.py:
from pathlib import Path
ROOT_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent

using:
from mlbox.settings import ROOT_DIR

    model_path = ROOT_DIR / "models" / "Yolo" / "yolov8m-seg_v1.pt"
    image_folder = ROOT_DIR / "Assets" / "test_peanuts_images"
    result_folder = image_folder / "result"
ANSWER: it's good idea.
