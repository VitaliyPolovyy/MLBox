1. User uploads a photo to ERP and  manually associates the photo with the input quality protocol document in the ERP.

2. User initiates ML processing. The user sends a REST API request to the ML service.
Request contains:
-Code of processing: Specifies the procedure to process the message and defines the format/type of response.
-The photo of peanuts to be processed.
-Total weight of all peanuts.
-Alias: DMZ (indicating the data refers to documents).
-Key: Internal identifier for the specific row of the input quality protocol.

3. Request confirmation: The user receives a message confirming the request has been received by the MLBox service or an error message if the request fails.

4. ML service processes and responds: The ML service sends a POST REST request back to the ERP.
Response contains:
-Service code: Matches the processing code from the request.
-Alias and key: Same as in the request, to link the response to the correct ERP record.
-Excel file:
--Sheet 1: A table of indicators:
---Index of each peanut.
---Area of each peanut (mmÂ²).
---Major ellipse diameter (mm).
---Minor ellipse diameter (mm).
---Class name.
---Confidence level (accuracy of the classification).

--Sheet 1: Summary indicators:
---Weight of the sample batch (grams).
---Count of whole peanuts in one ounce.
---Overall confidence.

--Sheet 2: Post-processed image:
---Image with overlaid ellipses and indexes.


5, The ERP processes the response and automatically attaches the Excel file and post-processed image to the input quality protocol.

Workflow ends: The user retrieves the Excel file from the ERP for their own processing
