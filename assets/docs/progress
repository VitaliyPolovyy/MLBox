git --- DONE ---
- ML ops: Ray Serve: EPR=>Ray=>ITE (prototype requests)
- script utils: create "cvtools.py"
- script preprocessing: create script for converting raw images into clear dataset images ("a4_image_processor.py")
- dataset: take photos of all batches of peanuts
- dataset: rename the files according to the peanut batches
- dataset: a4 preprocessing of raw images
- dataset: auto annotation of 50 images
- dataset: manually annotation of 50 images: 90sec per image
- dataset 2: cut out peanuts individually and save them as separate images - test
- dataset: auto annotation of all images
- vast.ai: prepare script
- dataset: agree on an annotation with Svitlana
- vast.ai: train YOLOv8 on 50 pictures
- Git: create repo and commit, share to Andrii
- ML ops:  WSL
- VS Code
- ML: install PyEnv
- ML: install poetry
- RAY: settings up and test
- dataset: join dataset (760 images)
- train yolo on vast.ai (1024)
- test trained yolo (1024)
- Integrate huggingface_hub
- format code with isort and black
- create peanut.py with basic workflow
- DATASET for  class : cut out peanuts individually and save them as separate images
- run serve ray using  use Serve config
- send image to ray serve from ERP
- retrain yolov8seg to show Andrew
- detect_white_rec - is broken
- DATASET for  class: prepare dataset for training
- use palint
- use json schema for: response

--- IN PROGRESS ---


- collect the  pictures of corex for new task

- how to detect multymodes data


- find out how to backup project rightly
- explore how to organize taking photo for ML in remote 


- explore git
+ "ML in production" course on coursera: 



--- NEXT ---


- bad result
--- bad masks
--- bad rotated bounding boxes
--- bad fit elipse 

- Integrate dataset control version for dataset
- train yolo on vast.ai (640) and compare with (1024)
